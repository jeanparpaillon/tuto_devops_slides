## Issue 6: Update DRAFT file with 2-day tutorial content

**Title**: Clean up and align DRAFT file with new structure

**Labels**: `documentation`, `cleanup`, `low-priority`

**Body**:
```markdown
## Description

The DRAFT file contains early planning notes that are now outdated. Update it to reflect the new 2-day tutorial structure or remove obsolete content.

## Current State

The DRAFT file contains:
- ✅ Useful concepts (Traditional vs DevOps approach)
- ✅ Exercise outlines for git
- ✅ GitHub Actions structure
- ⚠️ Outdated planning notes
- ⚠️ Incomplete sections

## Proposed Actions

### Option 1: Archive

Rename to `DRAFT.old` and create new DRAFT focused on:
- 2-day tutorial outline
- Detailed timing for each section
- Instructor notes
- Setup requirements

### Option 2: Update

Keep existing content but:
- Add section for 2-day tutorial
- Mark outdated sections clearly
- Add references to new structure in README

### Option 3: Remove

If content is fully integrated into slides and README:
- Move useful content to appropriate files
- Delete DRAFT
- Document decision in commit message

## Recommended Approach: Option 2 (Update)

1. Add header explaining purpose of file
2. Separate content into sections:
   - 5-day program planning
   - 2-day tutorial planning
   - Exercise ideas
   - Concepts to cover
3. Add dates and context for historical reference

## Files to Update

- `DRAFT`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DRAFT file purpose is clear
- [ ] No conflicting information with README
- [ ] Useful planning notes preserved
- [ ] Outdated content marked or removed
- [ ] 2-day tutorial planning added if keeping file

## Reference

- `PRODUCTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
```

## Issue 7: Consider creating separate slide deck for 2-day tutorial

**Title**: Create formation-prod-2day.md for condensed tutorial format

**Labels**: `slides`, `structure`, `enhancement`, `2-day-tutorial`

**Body**:
```markdown
## Description

Consider creating a separate slide deck specifically for the 2-day infrastructure tutorial, or add conditional slide inclusion to support both 5-day and 2-day formats from a single source.

## Current State

- ✅ `slides/formation-prod.md` exists for 5-day program
- ✅ README documents both 5-day and 2-day formats
- ⚠️ Only one slide deck exists
- ⚠️ Some slides may be too detailed for 2-day format
- ⚠️ Some slides needed for 2-day may not exist yet

## Options

### Option 1: Separate Slide Deck

Create `slides/formation-prod-2day.md` with:
- Only slides needed for 2-day tutorial
- Condensed content where appropriate
- Focus on hands-on exercises
- Less theory, more practice

**Pros**:
- Clear separation
- Easier to maintain focused content
- Can optimize for different audiences

**Cons**:
- Content duplication
- Need to maintain two decks
- Risk of divergence

### Option 2: Conditional Inclusion

Use slidev features to conditionally include slides:
- Tags or metadata for 5-day vs 2-day
- Build different outputs from same source
- Shared slide files

**Pros**:
- Single source of truth
- No duplication
- Updates apply to both

**Cons**:
- More complex build process
- May require custom slidev configuration
- Need to research slidev capabilities

### Option 3: Keep Current Approach

Use single deck with clear sections:
- Mark slides as "5-day only" or "2-day only"
- Instructors choose which to present
- Keep all content in one place

**Pros**:
- Simple
- No build changes
- Flexible for instructors

**Cons**:
- Deck may become unwieldy
- Harder to navigate for specific format
- No automated filtering

## Recommended Approach: Option 1 (Separate Deck)

Create `slides/formation-prod-2day.md` with structure:

```markdown
---
theme: the-unnamed
title: DevOps Infrastructure Tutorial (2 Days)
mdc: true
---

# Infrastructure Tutorial
## Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes

### 2-Day Hands-on Workshop

---
src: ./pages/about-me.md
---

# Day 1

---
src: ./pages/prod-terraform.md
---

---
src: ./pages/prod-ansible-basics.md
---

---
src: ./pages/prod-k8s-setup.md  # May need new condensed version
---

# Day 2

---
src: ./pages/prod-k8s-apps.md
---

---
src: ./pages/prod-scaling-lb.md  # Or integrated in k8s-apps
---

---
src: ./pages/prod-conclusion-2day.md  # Custom conclusion
---
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `slides/formation-prod-2day.md`
2. Identify which existing slide files work as-is
3. Identify which need condensed versions
4. Create new slide files for gaps:
   - `prod-k8s-setup.md` (Day 1 focus)
   - `prod-conclusion-2day.md` (specific to 2-day)
   - Any others needed
5. Update build configuration to generate both decks
6. Update README with links to both slide decks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Decision made on approach
- [ ] If creating separate deck: `formation-prod-2day.md` created
- [ ] All referenced slide files exist
- [ ] Slides build successfully for both formats (if separate)
- [ ] README updated with links to appropriate slide decks
- [ ] Documentation explains when to use each deck
- [ ] No broken references

## Questions to Resolve

1. Will 2-day tutorial have different audience than 5-day?
2. Should 2-day slides be more hands-on focused?
3. Is there value in maintaining both, or should we pick one?
4. What does Slidev support for conditional inclusion?

## Files to Create/Update

- Potentially create `slides/formation-prod-2day.md`
- Update `README.md` with slide deck links
- Update `netlify.toml` or build config if needed

## Reference

- `README.md` 2-day tutorial structure
- `PRODUCTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md` recommendations
- Current `slides/formation-prod.md`
```
