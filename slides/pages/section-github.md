# Git vs GitHub

## What's the difference?

**Git** (Local)
- Distributed version control system
- Works offline on your machine
- Manages code history locally
- Created by Linus Torvalds (2005)

**GitHub** (Remote/Cloud)
- Web-based hosting platform for Git repositories
- Collaboration and social features
- Project management tools
- CI/CD integration

<!--
Presenter notes:
- Screenshot suggestion: Split screen showing Git terminal commands on left and GitHub web interface on right
- Illustration idea: Icons representing offline (Git) vs online (GitHub) with connecting arrows
- Key point: Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform that hosts Git repositories
- Mention alternatives like GitLab, Bitbucket for context
-->

3. Open a Pull Request
4. Team reviews the code
5. Address feedback
6. Merge to main branch

**PR = Quality Gate**

# Code Review best practices

## Why review code?

- Catch bugs early
- Share knowledge
- Maintain code quality
- Enforce standards

## Review guidelines

✅ Be constructive and respectful
✅ Focus on code, not the person
✅ Explain the "why" behind suggestions
✅ Approve when satisfied
❌ Avoid nitpicking minor style issues

<!--

# Merge strategies

## Different ways to integrate changes

**Merge commit**
- Preserves full history
- Creates a merge commit
- All commits remain visible

**Squash and merge**
- Combines all commits into one
- Cleaner history
- Loses individual commit details

**Rebase and merge**
- Linear history
- No merge commit
- Rewrites commit history

<!--
Presenter notes:
- Screenshot suggestion: Git graph showing all three merge strategies side by side

# Branch protection rules

## Enforce quality standards

**Common protections:**
- Require pull request reviews (1, 2, or more)
- Require status checks to pass (CI/CD)
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict who can push to branch
- Require signed commits

**Benefits:**
- Prevent accidental deletions
- Ensure code quality
- Maintain stable main branch

<!--
Presenter notes:
- Screenshot suggestion: GitHub branch protection settings page with all options visible
- Screenshot suggestion: Example of blocked push due to protection rules
- Illustration idea: Shield icon with checkmarks showing protected vs unprotected branch

---

# Branch protection — example

```yaml
Protected branch: main

✅ Require pull request before merging
   ✅ Require 2 approvals
   ✅ Dismiss stale reviews
   
✅ Require status checks to pass
   ✅ build
   ✅ test
   ✅ lint
   
✅ Require conversation resolution
✅ Require linear history
✅ Include administrators
```
