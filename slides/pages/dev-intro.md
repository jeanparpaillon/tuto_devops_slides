# DevOps: approach vs traditional

- Silos vs collaboration
- Long cycles vs short iterations
- Manual work vs automation (CI/CD, IaC)
- Dev environments ≈ Prod environments

---

# The DevOps lifecycle

- Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Feedback
- Continuous measurement and continuous improvement

---

# Sample Node.js application

- Minimal HTTP API (Express, Fastify)
- npm scripts: dev, test, build
- Optional Makefile
- Best practices: .nvmrc, .editorconfig, linters

# Git — basics (recap)

- init, add, commit, log
- branches: feature, release, hotfix
- merge vs rebase
- tags (versions)

---

# GitHub — collaboration

- repository, issues, pull requests
- branch protections
- GitHub Actions: overview (details on Day 2)
