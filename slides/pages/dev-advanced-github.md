# Day 5 — Advanced GitHub usage

## Objectives

- Go beyond basics with GitHub Actions
- Explore advanced triggers and workflows
- Leverage GitHub for project management

---

# Day 5 — Building on the Week

**Day 1**: Git & GitHub basics → branches, PRs

**Day 2**: CI/CD basics → first workflows

**Day 3**: Artifacts → dependency management

**Day 4**: Security → SonarQube, Xray

**Today**: Advanced Actions & project management

# GitHub Actions — advanced triggers

**Recall from Day 2**: We created workflows with `on: push`

**Today**: We expand to sophisticated triggers

- on: schedule (cron)
- on: issue_comment, issues, pull_request_review
- on: workflow_run (chained workflows)
- Path filters and conditional jobs

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths: [ 'src/**', '!docs/**' ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 7 * * 1-5' # weekdays 7am UTC
```

---

# Reusable and composite workflows

- Reusable workflows with workflow_call
- Composite actions to share steps

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reuse.yml
on: workflow_call
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: make ci
```

---

# Environments and approvals

- Protected environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Required reviewers and wait timers
- Environment secrets and variables

---

# Caching and artifacts

**Building on Day 3**: We learned about artifact management with Artifactory

**Today**: GitHub's built-in artifact and caching features

- actions/cache for dependencies
- upload/download-artifact for build outputs
- Retention and size limits

---

# GitHub-native security

**Building on Day 4**: We learned SonarQube and Xray

**Today**: GitHub's integrated security features

- CodeQL for code scanning
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- Secret scanning
- Security advisories

# Complete workflow example

Bringing together all 5 days:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/complete-pipeline.yml
name: Complete CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]          # Day 1: Git workflows
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'         # Day 5: Advanced triggers

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Day 2: CI/CD automation
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          
      # Day 3: Artifact caching
      - name: Cache dependencies

# Project management with GitHub

- Issues, labels, milestones
- Projects (tables/boards), workflows automation
- Discussions and Wikis
- Code Owners and branch protection rules

---

# Practical exercises

- Add scheduled maintenance workflow
- Create reusable workflow for testing
- Set up environment protections for staging/prod
- Create a Project board with automation
