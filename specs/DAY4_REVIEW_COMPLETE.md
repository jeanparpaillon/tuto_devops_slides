## 📝 Summary

This review identified that Day 4 content is critically insufficient for a full-day training session. The current 9 slides would take only 45-90 minutes to present, far short of the required 6-8 hours.

**Critical improvements needed:**
1. Expand content by 300% (9 → 35-40 slides)
2. Add 5 hands-on exercises (195 minutes)
3. Add Artifactory integration content
4. Add depth on SonarQube and Xray topics
5. Add architecture diagrams and structure

**All recommendations are documented with:**
- Detailed specifications
- Concrete examples
- Priority levels
- Effort estimates
- Implementation guides
- Ready-to-use issue templates

**The review is complete and ready for your approval to begin implementation.**
